#PyCAS


This is meant to be act as a CAS service for developers working on projects that require this service. This is not to be used in place of real CAS setup (obviously), but can fake it while a developer is working on other features.

This was intended as  a python-only replacement for [the Go version](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/fakeCAS)

Future updates:
* Proper logging
* Program options
* Cleanup
